# ARK Config File Manager

## Overview

The ARK Config File Manager provides a user-friendly interface for managing configuration files (`.ini` files) for ARK: Survival Evolved/SOTF/Ascended.  
While ARK offers many in-game settings, advanced customisations require modifying configuration files directly. This application hopes to simplify that process with a UI.

## Features

- **Visual Configuration Editor**: Edit complex configuration settings through an intuitive UI.
- **Preset Management**: Save and load commonly used configuration presets. (Not yet implemented)
- **Syntax Validation**: Avoid errors with built-in validation for ARK's configuration syntax. (Not yet implemented)
- **Import/Export**: Easily import existing config files and export your modifications.
