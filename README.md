# ARK Config File Manager

## Overview

The ARK Config File Manager provides a user-friendly interface for managing configuration files (`.ini` files) for ARK: Survival Evolved/SOTF/Ascended.  
While ARK offers many in-game settings, advanced customisations require modifying configuration files directly. This application hopes to simplify that process with a UI.

## Features

- **Managing your files**: You can easily view, edit, and save your config files with this app.
- **Browsing other's uploaded files**: You can also go to the share tab to browse other people's uploaded config files.
- **Share your own!**: You can share your own config files with others by uploading in the app.
